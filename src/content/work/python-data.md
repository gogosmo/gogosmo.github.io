> #### Python 🐍 Data Science Learning Project 

This GitHub repository is dedicated to teaching and demonstrating key Python concepts 🐍 used in data science 📊. It is designed as a learning resource for those looking to enhance their Python and data science skills, as well as a means for me to document and showcase my skills in these fields.

##### 🎯 Project Objective

The project has a dual purpose:

1. 📚 Highlight and document Python concepts I master, particularly those used in data science, and keep them in a training mode for future reference.
2. 💡 Present concrete examples of these concepts in the form of code and result videos to aid understanding.

##### 📁 Repository Contents

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a key Python concept used in data science. Each folder contains a README file describing the concept, one or more Python code files demonstrating the concept, and possibly a video 🎥 showing the code in action.
